# CHANGELOG

> The Change Log of Vue2 Timepicker `vue2-timepicker`

## v 0.2.2

### Fixes

Fixes `v-model` watcher for cases like changing the input value programmatically (non-user behavior).

### Improvements

Added `displayTime` in the return data of `@change` event.

## v 0.2.1

### New

- New `input-class` support. The custom input class will be assigned to the `<input type="text">` within the component. (Thanks to @marufmax)
- Add support to `placeholder`, just like other regular form elements

### Improvements

Refined `@click.stop` logic

### Fixes

Fixes possible loader issue in some Webpack configs (Thanks to @RaphaelJ)

## v 0.2.0

### Breaking Changes

- Upgraded to support more current **vue** (2.6.10) and **vue-cli** (3.9.0) with Webpack 4.

### New

- New `hour-range` support. Added capability to show which hours are available and disabled the rest.
- New `hide-disabled-hours`. The best companion of `hour-range`, for you to hide unwanted hours in the hour picker.

### Improvements

- Put `12` before `1` in the hour select for 12-hour format (`hh` and `h`). It will be more natural, especially when paired with `hour-range`.
